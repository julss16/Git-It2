      <p>STEM is the world's main tool for innovation and advancement. Every time we create something new or something that makes life easier, we make the world a better place. Therefore, every act in the name of STEM is an act in the name of humanity and for the betterment of humanity. I think that all STEM professionals have a civic duty. Whether it's just sharing their creativity and problem-solving skills so they can encourage others, or using their career to create things that make life better, they have to fulfill this thinking.
When I think about this, I think about the different STEM programs and opportunities that I've experienced or heard of: FIRST, NASA SEES, FemmeHacks, Girls Who Code. These organizations aren't curing cancer (though, they could because that would also help to make the world a better place), but they are spreading knowledge and inspiring the next generation. I think that if I, too, can inspire other people, then I think I would have succeed in helping others. That might be just leading by example. At some point, I would like a start a foundation that focuses on helping girls get into STEM and then a separate project that helps underprivileged children around the world advance their own careers.
Concerning social justice, change is made in waves. It'll take a large group of people to make a wave big enough to cause era-defining change. This goes back to the ideas of innovation and advancement; once enough people (in STEM) start making advocating for change, spreading awareness, and acting out that change, then we make can make a big enough change. By statring or improving current groups that help young people of all backgrounds learn about STEM, I can help to make the world a better place. I also help that once I have established a large platform in STEM people will be wiling to listen to what I have to say about topics outside of STEM education (the education disparity is a major issue, but there are also so many human rights issues that need to be voiced as well).

      <h2>We Asked 6 Women STEM Entrepreneurs Their Advice to Others Following Their Path. Here’s What They Said.</h2>
      <h5> March 4, 2018</h5>
      <br>
      <p>Starting a business is hard work. Unfortunately for women in STEM fields, it can be even harder.

Women founders received less than two percent of the $85 billion invested by venture capitalists last year, according to Fortune Magazine. And although women fill close to half of all jobs in the U.S. economy and are starting businesses at twice the rate of men, they hold less than 25 percent of STEM jobs nationwide.

But there is a generation of innovative women entrepreneurs pushing for change, fighting for opportunity, and who aren’t taking no for an answer. February 11th is International Day of Women and Girls in Science. In honor of that, Free Enterprise asked seven brave women entrepreneurs in the STEM fields to let us know one piece of advice they wish they had known when they got started.  Here’s what they said.

“As women entrepreneurs in STEM, we often find ourselves alone in the process of starting and running a business – as most other companies and STEM fields are heavily male-dominated. To get over this hurdle, we are constantly watching women-led organizations and joining entrepreneurship groups that focus on STEM education and small businesses.

Finding like-minded individuals that have a drive for business and passion for their work has been the most effective way to receive and provide aid. Our best advice is to find a group or organization that you can actively participate in. This group will provide you the space to listen, learn, and give back.”

“As a woman in this industry, you will face a lot of doubters. There will be double standards. And sometimes there will be triple standards. Everyone tells you these things in advance, and you know these things are true. But when it happens it’s still a surprise. It’s still a slap in the face. You have to be better than average, and you have to know much more than the average start-up, because investors will demand it of you.

“One thing that helps is having truly great partners. If you can be strategic with your network and with who you do business with and can lean on them to support you when needed it takes some of the pressure to know everything off. It doesn’t fix everything, but it goes a long way.”

“Be honest with people about what you’re struggling with and ask for help.  I’m now on my 4th startup, and I’ve gotten to be very transparent about what I’m struggling with.  When I started my first startup, whenever people asked me how things were going, I’d always respond with “awesome!”  If you keep doing that, then your network can’t help you.  So get out there and start talking about what you’re struggling with!

People always talk about women having the imposter syndrome.  I think the imposter syndrome gets a bad rap.  I have felt like an imposter most of my life and I think it’s great.  It means that I’m learning and growing.   These days, once I feel comfortable in a role, I realize it might be time to leave because I’m stagnating.  I say lean into the imposter syndrome.”

“I think a great mentality that our team has which has allowed us to get to where we are is shooting for lofty goals, no matter how insurmountable the challenge may seem. You eat an elephant a bite at a time, and that’s a state of mind that helps us tackle big projects that others may have written off as impossible, like our current R&D project of creating a 3D printer that will use recycled plastic trash as feedstock.

The same advice can go for women in tech and STEM fields – you are every bit as qualified as anyone else, so set your sights high and take things one step at a time. The world needs big dreamers and people who will execute on a vision.

“Whether it’s negotiating a deal, salary, or agency, contracts are at the center of our business. While there are many ways to approach a negotiation, the choices you make can have a huge impact on your business and its bottom line.

My advice is to always look at how the contract can be ended (especially if you are the client). I have had expensive ‘lessons’ where I was stuck in a 6-month contract with an agency and while we were both clearly unhappy – but I was bound to the bitter end.”

“Imagine what success looks like as a business owner in a few years in the future, and then figure out what you need to do to get there.  Ask other scientist-run startups for advice on how to get started and how to grow your business. Find more experienced business and technical people in your verticals for advisors. Create a community of other startup founders to share your wins and loses with. Be patient.”

      <p>I know this sounds cheesy, but for me, success is being happy. It's realizing that you achieved the goals you set out for yourself and you've achieved the things you didn't even know you set out to do. It's being able to look back on your decisions and being satisfied with the outcome. That outcome could be money, happiness, love. It could be anything as long as you've seen yourself grow and you are happy with the end result.
When I think about the time that everything went wrong, I realize it felt like everything went wrong because I had very high expectations for myself that I didn't achieve and  I felt really accomplished when I achieved everything that I needed to. For me to feel accomplished, I just have to set reasonable goals and not overwork or overextend myself.
When I think of admissions I think of the holistic review. At every event where admissions officers discuss what they're looking for, they make sure to note that they are not just looking for success in academics or students who are the best at everything all the time and they have never experienced failure. They view excellence as being able to bounce back, adapt, learn.  The ideal person that they see succeeding at their school is someone who is driven and wants to do more, but is also true to themselves and where they came from. An indicator might be a really passionate essay, activities that show how much a student values a specific subject, an interview where both the interviewer and the interviewee were able to have good, genuine conversation, or even just a letter of recommendation where a teacher praised the student for who they are as a person. To be honest, I don't think there is a clear indicator of excellence that checks a box and puts you in the "yes" pile. I think the admissions officer have an idea of what kinds of student would thrive in their schools and they can get a good sense of that through every part of your application.
I hope that in my application, admissions officers assess not just my experiences, but how those experiences molded me into a person. My idea of success in the admissions process, is really conveying who you are and what you value to a school where your interests, your aspirations, your identity, and your individuality are valued.
